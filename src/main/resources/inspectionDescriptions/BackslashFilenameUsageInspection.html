        This inspection identifies the use of backslash (eg. <code>dir\file.php</code>) in File System related functions,
        also taking into account the <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> expressions.<br /><br />

        Only Windows allows the use of backslash. When running the file on a Unix server, for example,
        you are likely to run into serious problems.
