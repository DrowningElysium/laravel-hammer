        This inspection helps normalize the format of increment and decrement
        unary expressions (<code>$a++</code> and <code>$a--</code>, respectively),
        allowing to decide which side the operator should be present.<br /><br />

        However, not every unary expression can be modified,
        so this inspection only acts in safe conditions.
