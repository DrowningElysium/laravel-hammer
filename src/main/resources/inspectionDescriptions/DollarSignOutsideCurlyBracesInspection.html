        This inspection checks the usage of the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) outside of the curly braces on strings,
        which is deprecated as of PHP 8.2.<br /><br />

        <strong>Important:</strong> using dollar sign <strong>inside</strong> curly braces is still allowed (eg. <code>"{$x}"</code>),
        what is no longer allowed is using <strong>outside</strong> (eg. <code>"${x}"</code>).<br /><br />

        The difference in usage is subtle, so this inspection can help you avoid this type of problem.
