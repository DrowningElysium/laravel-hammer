        This inspection checks the use of the <strong>error control operator</strong>,
        also known as <strong>at-operator</strong> (<code>@</code>) which allows you to suppress
        errors that may occur during the execution of the function.<br /><br />

        However, its use is not recommended, since important errors can be suppressed and
        modify the expected behavior of the application.<br /><br />

        Only at specific points this operator must be used, such as to avoid a race condition using functions like <code>mkdir()</code>.
