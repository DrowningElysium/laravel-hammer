        <strong>ðŸ”¨ PHP Hammer</strong> is installed now!<br /><br />

        This is an under <strong>development version</strong>, where you can submit suggestions and feedbacks on our
        <strong>Github $home</strong>.<br /><br />

        That's all this plugin can do at the moment: <strong>$inspections supported</strong>.<br /><br />

        <strong>âš  Important:</strong> in the future this plugin will become <strong>$freemium</strong>.
        Which means that some features will no longer be free, however, inspections will continue to be
        available for free.
